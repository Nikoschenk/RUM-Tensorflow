# Rotational Unit of Memory (RUM)-Tensorflow

Here we present the implementation of a novel RNN model--RUM--which outperforms significantly the current frontier of models in a variety of sequential tasks. The Rotational Unit combines the memorization advantage of unitary/orthogonal matrices with the dynamic structure of associative memory.
